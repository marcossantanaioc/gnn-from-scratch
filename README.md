# GNN From Scratch 🧠🧪  
Implementing Graph Neural Networks from scratch.

This repository contains **from-scratch implementations** of foundational Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) described in the literature, with a focus on molecular property prediction. Each model is implemented in PyTorch, using minimal dependencies and emphasizing clarity and reproducibility.
